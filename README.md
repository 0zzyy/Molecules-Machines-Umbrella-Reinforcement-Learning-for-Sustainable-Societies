# Umbrella Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Societies
Umbrella Reinforcement Learning accelerates chemistry development by integrating predictive models, molecular simulations, and societal constraints. This iterative, data-driven approach minimizes toxicity, fosters equitable policies, and bridges technical expertise with sustainability. 

Made for the Virtual Winter School on Computational Chemistry 2025, sponsored by the School of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the demo: `python umbrella_rl_demo.py`
